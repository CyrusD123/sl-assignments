# sl-assignments
The SLSD Assignment Completion Database allows teachers and administrators of the Southern Lehigh School Distict to easily track which students have completed what assignments during periods of distance learning. The website works by allowing teachers to select a subject and write out the ID numbers of each student that did not complete the assignments for the subject. This information is used to update a database containing every student's information. (The database can be viewed under the "Results" tab.)

Each student is marked as having their assignments completed by default. This way, only the students who have not completed their work have to be entered. All changes are permanent, but the database resets to default every Monday at 9:00 AM EST.
